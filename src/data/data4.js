Turn off the heat and add the remaining butter, letting the residual heat melt this. Once it's melted, use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir in the sugars.",

    "Add the eggs one at a time, blending completely after each one, then add the vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and fold just until there's barely any trace of flour. Add the chocolate chips and stir until just combined and the chocolate chips are evenly dispersed. Cover with cling film (plastic wrap) and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably 4. The flavours meld a little better this way.",

    "Scoop the dough out on a baking sheet using a mediumsized cookie scoop, or about 11/2 tablespoons of dough, and sprinkle with sea salt. I like to bake 9 on a sheet. Bake for 12-14 minutes on baking parchment, one baking sheet at a time, rotating the sheet halfway through. You want them to be slightly golden brown around the edges and appear to be under-baked. This ensures beautifully chewy cookies. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet then transfer to a cooling rack."

    "**Frozen berries tend to be a little juicier so that's the route I'd take for these, but feel free to use fresh raspberries if you have them",

    "Blitz the raspberries and water in a blender until smooth. Strain out any seeds; you should be left with about 160 ml (2/3 cup) of purée. If not, add enough water to make it 160 ml (2/3 cup).",

    "In the bowl of a stand mixer, pour 80 ml (1/3 cup) of the raspberry purée, sprinkle over the gelatine,  and gently mix to make sure all the gelatine is in contact with the Liquid.",

    "In a medium saucepan combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup, salt, and the remaining purée. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches 115t (240 °F) on a sugar thermometer; this should take about 4-6 minutes. ",

    "With the mixer on low, slowly pour the hot sugar mixture into the gelatine raspberry mixture. Once it is all in there, kick up the mixer to a notch below the highest setting and Let it go until Light, fluffy, pale, and the bottom of the bowl that was hot is now barely warm — around 6—10 min. Add the vanilla extract and go for about 30 seconds more.",

    "While this is happening you can prep the baking sheet. Mix the cornflour and icing sugar together in a bowl and set aside. Lightly grease a 20 x 20 cm (8 x 8 in) sheet, then sift in most of the marshmallow coating, making sure all the sides are Lightly covered; it helps to sift a bunch in, tap the sides and bottom, and rotate the sheet. Reserve a couple of tablespoons of coating for later.",

    "Once the marshmallow mixture is done, quickly scrape it into the prepared sheet and smooth it out. It's gonna be sticky but just deal with it and don't freak out. Once it's in the sheet and probably freakishly sort of smoothed out, sift a tablespoon of coating on the top. Boom. Congratulations, you've just made marshmallows.",

    "Let the sheet sit out for at least 4 hours, probably closer to 6 just to be safe, then pop the marshmallows out onto a cutting board and carefully cut into 2h or 4 cm (1 or 11/2 in) squares using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, or a small round biscuit cutter.",

    "Once they're all cut up, toss in a Large (1 gallon) zip-top bag, sift in the remaining tablespoon of coating and shake the bag to get all the sides coated. Store in the zip-top bag for up to 2 weeks."
